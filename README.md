# TeamDisasterML
Team Disaster ML project


Project Scope:
We will create a model that will predict the type of disaster that will occur in a given area and the magnitude of that disaster. We will extend this model to predict the approximate number of people affected and show that # of affected strongly correlates with financial aspects and that certain areas should increase their spending on weather proof infrastructure instead of retroactive disaster relief.
